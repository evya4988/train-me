            About Us
            <br />
            <br />
            Hello,
            <br />Our names are Shay Barnea and Evyatar Hale, and we are a students in GO-CODE
            <br />Academy as part of Full Stack Web Development course.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of our final project we built a system,
            which mediates between physical training coaches and clients interested in these services,<br />
            It allows trainers to create, edit and delete their courses, and clients to view and register for these courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of effort was given to this project, which is a product of 2 months of hard work that has taught us a lot.
            <br />Enjoy!
          </p>
